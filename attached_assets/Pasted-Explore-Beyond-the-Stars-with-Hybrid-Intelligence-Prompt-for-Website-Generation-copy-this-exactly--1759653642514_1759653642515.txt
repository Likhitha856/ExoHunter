Explore Beyond the Stars with Hybrid Intelligence

Prompt for Website Generation (copy this exactly):

Create a visually stunning space-themed website called “ExoHunter”, an AI platform that detects exoplanets using NASA open datasets and a hybrid fusion model (CNN + XGBoost).
The website should have a dark cosmic interface with glowing nebula gradients (deep violet, navy blue, cyan accents), animated planetary backgrounds, and a clean futuristic UI.

Pages & Features:

1️⃣ Landing / Welcome Page

Title: “🪐 ExoHunter – The Exoplanet Discovery AI”

Tagline: “Explore the Unknown. Detect the Undiscovered.”

Animated starfield or orbiting planets in the background.

“Get Started” button → redirects to Signup/Login page.

2️⃣ Signup & Login Page

Glassmorphism cards with glowing blue borders.

User can sign up using Email + Password or Login.

Add an optional Google sign-in button.

Background animation of moving stars or rotating exoplanet.

Once logged in → redirect to the Dashboard.

3️⃣ Dashboard / Home

Welcome user by name (e.g. “Welcome, Explorer Chaitanya 👋”).

Sidebar with options:

🧠 “Run AI Detection”

📈 “View Dataset Insights”

☄️ “ExoVisuals” (interactive plots)

🔍 “Explainability (SHAP)”

📜 “About NASA Dataset”

Central card showing Upload CSV option.

When user uploads → show preview table + “Run ExoFusion AI” button.

4️⃣ Results Page

Animated loader (orbiting planet or scanning beam).

Display detection result in a glowing card:

🟢 “Confirmed Exoplanet Detected!”

🔵 “Possible Candidate Detected”

🔴 “No Exoplanet Found”

Show charts of:

Light Curve (time vs flux)

Feature Importance (bar / SHAP plot)

Include “Re-run Analysis” and “Download Report (PDF)” buttons.

5️⃣ About Page

Describe the mission of ExoHunter, NASA dataset sources (Kepler, K2, TESS).

Include small planet GIFs, floating asteroids, and faint galaxy motion.

Design & Aesthetic:

Background: animated nebula gradients.

Fonts: futuristic (Orbitron, Exo, Rajdhani).

Buttons: glowing, rounded 2xl, hover = color shift (purple → cyan).

Animations: subtle floating / parallax scroll of stars.

Add a small footer with “🚀 Powered by NASA Open Data & AI Fusion”.

Optional Add-ons:

3D planet viewer (use Three.js or Spline embed).

Voice assistant: “Hey ExoHunter, detect a planet!”

Data visualization with Plotly (interactive).

Output: One complete responsive website (HTML, CSS, JS in a single file if possible) that runs locally or on Streamlit.
